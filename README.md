# Exp

A very simple [parser combinator](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.pdf) library implementation in Elixir.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `exp` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:exp, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/exp>.
